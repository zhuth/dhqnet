# "Dinghaiqiao Mutual Aid Intranet" art project

## Objective

The art project aims at rediscovering so-called `Internet spirit' in the era of Intranet. Recall that in the age when Internet access is highly limited (of use) and expensive, huge amounts of Intranets have been set up in especially universities, BBS and FTP servers helped greatly local people get communicated and share their information. In the era of Internet, the superfically highly connected community of Net-citizens is doomed to be seperated due to powers they cannot control. The Internet, depicted as a `worldwide web,' is prone to be utilized as a new centralized mass media rather than a cyberspace where everyone shares equal rights to express and share. The theoretical possibility of the slogans like `everyone could be a center' is actually devalued by a few pro-media influential people. The majority, however, are used to gain information from these single, centralized channels. The posperity of `Big-V's on Weibo and `public subscribings' at Weixin demonstrates such medium-ization. On the other hand, for some ordinary people, the Internet provides the vanity of `speaking to the whole world/country/community,' which is, as we know, totally an illusion.

Based on the local art project `Dinghaiqiao Mutual Aid Society,' the present project aims to set up an wireless Intranet at Dinghaiqiao, so as to call back the spirit of `Internet spirit.' We wonder, what may happen if there exists an Intranet, who will use it? how? and for what purpose? Furthermore, if we allow (but not encourage) the user to edit and even delete other's posts, what may come? Will there be any hackers, and will they provide free access to the Internet or simply destroy the service? Etc., etc. We purpose a series of questions and provide the possibility, and observe.

## This Repo
This repo contains code for a portal page of the project. In near future more codes and (probably) codes will be added for anyone who has a similar interest of setting-up a local network.
